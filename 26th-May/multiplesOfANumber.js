// Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first (n) multiples of (x).

// Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

// Return the results as an array (or list in Python, Haskell or Elixir).

// Examples:

// countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
// countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]

//pseudo code
//create an empty area
//loop through with a starting point of 1 and an end point of lesser than or equal to n
//to get the multiples we multiply x by 1 and push until we get to a number lesser than or equal to n
//return z

function countBy(x, n) {
  let z = [];
